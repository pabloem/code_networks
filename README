Social Network Analysis - Optional Programming Project
Author: Pablo Estrada

Description of each file and what it is used for:

- SNA_project_PabloEstrada.pdf
  - This is the project writeup paper. It is organized somewhat like an academic
  paper, trying to include the parts suggested by professor Adamic.
- SNA_project.R
  - This is the R code to analyze all the data. It is not supposed to be run
  completely. It is supposed to be read through and run by parts, depending on
  what information one wants to obtain and plot.
- include_network.sh
  - This is the shell script to generate the Pajek .NET graph files from the
  software project. It can be run from the root directory and it will generate
  the file including all subdirectories.  It can be manually tuned, and I en-
  courage you to take a look into the file and the comments.
- *_pajek_2.net
  - I included the Pajek .NET files for the networks, in case you want to repli-
  cate the experiments without having to download the repositories. These can be
  imported into Gephi or R normall.
